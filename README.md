# Hostages Will Die

This is a woefully incomplete project by Hanabanashiku and Craig Snedeker for the 51 Ludum Dare Gamejam on Oct 3, 2022. This was our very first game (and game jam). Although unfinished, it was a huge learning experience and a lot of fun. 

The topic this go around was "Every 10 Seconds". Our concept is a hostage situation where a hostage dies every 10 seconds.
